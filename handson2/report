Design:
1. 100mhz clock to get a clock input -> 1hz count -> implement it into a 4bit 

Challenges encountered:
1. Syntax Error
2. Understanding the code to isolatae the 7 segment display and the clock counter

Lessons Learnt:
1. computer must be better :)
2. Test bench not possible because the hz is too high -> cannot generate the clock long enough to trigger the counter
