Design:
1. Using 100Hz clock input, design a traffic light algorithm that countsdown from 30 seconds and switches the lights according to a set time. 
2. Implemant an adder function to simulate exrending the crossing time for seniors.

Challenges in Verilog Traffic Light Controller Design
    1.State Management:
          Handling different light states (red, yellow, green).
          Ensuring smooth transitions and synchronization.
    2. Precise Timing:
      Accurate delays for state changes.
          Considering clock cycles and propagation.
          Synchronization Across Intersections:
      Optimizing traffic flow.
    3. Simulation and Verification:
          Debugging state transitions and timing.
          Ensuring correctness.
    4. Hardware Implementation:
          Mapping to actual hardware.
          Interfacing with displays.
